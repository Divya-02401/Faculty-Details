I have developed a web-based application that provides distinct functionalities for faculty and admin users. Faculty members can log in to view their details, while admins can access all faculty details for management purposes.
Responsibilities:
Designed and implemented the user interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly experience.
I have developed the backend using Python and FastAPI to handle user authentication, data retrieval, and server-side functionalities.
Created and managed the MySQL database to store user and faculty information securely.
Integrated JavaScript for dynamic content and client-side validation.
